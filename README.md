# CSCI 4176 & CSCI 5708: MathWiz : Group 13

This is s group project repository for the course CSCI CSCI 4176 & CSCI 5708 instructed by Professor Dr. Tami Meredith.

## MathWiz

MathWiz is a math-learning app for Canadian kids in grades 3 to 5. Its primary function is to quiz users in several grade-specific math categories that can be chosen from, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. The quiz questions are created dynamically. Users will be provided with their quiz results, and, overall statistics for each category. Quiz questions will be simple in form, multiple choice, and will give a sense of reward that is required to engage children of the target age range. Parents can utilize this app to help their children that may be struggling, in need of basic practice, or to supervise their learning. We were not able to fully implement reminders (Nice to have feature). But we were able to integrate its UI screen without the backend functionility.
